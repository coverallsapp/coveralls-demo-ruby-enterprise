# coveralls-ruby-demo

[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) demo project, using:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) — *Language*
* [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) — *Testing Library*
* [Simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) — *Test Coverage Library*

### How to run it:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

## About Coveralls

[Coveralls](http://coveralls.io) is a web service that sends test coverage reports to a shared workspace so you and your team can track your projects' test coverage over time. [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io) is language- and CI-agnostic, but it lets you control whether your builds pass or fail based on coverage metrics you define.

## How It Works

Before your project gets to [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io), it must already be using a code coverage library to generate coverage results ([Simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov), in this project).

Your CI service will run your tests, and your code coverage report, then post those results to [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io).

![how-it-works-simple.png](../media/media/how-it-works-simple.png?raw=true)

1. You commit changes to your repo at your SCM (GitHub).
2. Your CI service builds your project, runs your tests, and generates your test coverage report.
3. Your CI posts those results to Coveralls.
4. Coveralls updates your project with new coverage results.
5. (Optional) Coveralls posts PR comments and pass/fail checks to control your development workflow.

## Get Started

We'll set up this project to do all those things, following these four (4) steps:

1. Understand test coverage in this project
2. Run tests for the first time
3. Add tests and see coverage change
4. Configure this project to use [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io)

## 1. Understand test coverage in this project

<details>
  <summary>Do it.</summary>

---

This is the totality of the code in this project:

```ruby
class ClassOne

  def self.covered
    "covered"
  end

  def self.uncovered
    "uncovered"
  end

end
```

And these are the tests:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'
require 'class_one'

describe ClassOne do

  describe "covered" do
    it "returns 'covered'" do
      expect(ClassOne.covered).to eql("covered")
    end
  end

  # Uncomment below to achieve 100% coverage
  # describe "uncovered" do
  #   it "returns 'uncovered'" do
  #     expect(ClassOne.uncovered).to eql("uncovered")
  #   end
  # end
end
```

Notice that right now, only one of the two methods in `ClassOne` is being tested.

## 2. Run tests for the first time

<details>
  <summary>Do it.</summary>

---

Let's run the test suite for the first time and see what the results are.

If you haven't already, go ahead and clone the project down to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:afinetooth/coveralls-demo-ruby.git
```

Now, `cd` into `coveralls-demo-ruby` and run this command to install the dependencies:

```
bundle install
```

Finally, run the test suite, [Rspec](https://rspec.info/).

```
bundle exec rspec
```

You'll notice test results on the screen, which should look like this:

```ruby
<test results>
```

In additional to the test results themselves, we have the added benefit of test _coverage_ results, from using our test coverage library, [Simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov).

Every time we run our test suite, [Simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov), in the background, generates HTML-based code coverage results, which you can see by opening the newly created file at `/coverage/index.html` in your browser, or by issuing this command in your terminal:

```
open coverage/index.html
```

The first results should look like this:

![80% Coverage - Index View](../media/media/coverage_80_percent_index.png)

Where coverage stands at 80% for the entire project.

Clicking on `lib/class_one.rb` brings up results for the file:

![80% Coverage - File View](../media/media/coverage_80_percent_file.png?raw=true)

Where you'll notice covered lines in green, and uncovered lines in red.

In our case, 4/5 lines are covered, indicating 80% coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Why isn't coverage 50%?</summary>

---

One might expect the coverage results here to be 50%, given that `ClassOne` has two (2) methods (`covered` and `uncovered`) and we're only testing one of them. However, that's not how it works. Instead, Simplecov counts *relevant lines* in each file and compares the number of covered lines to uncovered lines to determine the file's coverage percentage.
</details>

</details>

## 3. Add tests and see coverage change

<details>
  <summary>Do it.</summary>

---

To "add" tests, simply un-comment the test of the second method in `ClassOne`:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'
require 'class_one'

describe ClassOne do

  describe "covered" do
    it "returns 'covered'" do
      expect(ClassOne.covered).to eql("covered")
    end
  end

  # Uncomment below to achieve 100% coverage
  describe "uncovered" do
    it "returns 'uncovered'" do
      expect(ClassOne.uncovered).to eql("uncovered")
    end
  end
end
```

Now run the test suite again:

```
bundle exec rspec
```

And open the new results at `coverage/index.html`.

Here's how things look now:

![100% Coverage - Index View](../media/media/coverage_100_percent_index.png?raw=true)

Notice coverage has increased from 80% to 100% (and turned green).

And now, if we click on `lib/class_one.rb` we see:

![100% Coverage - File View](../media/media/coverage_100_percent_file.png?raw=true)

Five (5) out of five (5) relevant lines are now covered, resulting in 100% coverage for the file, which means 100% coverage for our one-file project.

## 4. Configure this project to use Coveralls

<details>
  <summary>Do it.</summary>

---

Now that you understand how test coverage works in this project, you'll soon be able to verify the same results through [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io).

But first we’ll need to set up the CI pipeline.

### Which CI Service will you use?

Since your CI Service will be sending code coverage results to [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io), you'll need to choose a CI service and add this repo to it.<sup>*</sup>

Follow the branch for your CI service and we'll pick up the conversation there:

1. [Travis CI](https://github.com/afinetooth/coveralls-demo-ruby/tree/travis)
2. Circle CI
3. ...

<small>Technically speaking, there are other ways to send your test coverage results to <a href="http://coveralls.io">Coveralls</a> without a CI Service; namely, through the API. That's not the subject of this README, so to find out more see <a href="https://docs.coveralls.io/api-introduction">Coveralls API Docs</a>. You can find out about creating new repos <a href="https://coveralls.io/api/docs">here</a>, and about posting coverage results to those repos <a href="https://docs.coveralls.io/api-reference">here</a>.</small>
